OSM Shapefile QGIS stylesheets
==============================

*This repo contains QGIS stylesheets (QML) for use with OpenStreetMap (OSM) data in ESRI Shapefile format. It now also contains greyscale stylesheets courtesy of @mixedbredie*

##Background

I quite often use OSM data for personal mapping projects and I always use the ESRI Shapefiles from [Geofabrik](http://download.geofabrik.de/).
There aren't many stylesheets available for use with this data so I decided to make my own. I found [this set](https://github.com/3liz/osm-in-qgis) from 3liz and used them as my starting point.

##Info

These stylesheets have been designed to work at a large scale (1:4,000). They are legible between 1:2,000 and 1:5,000. I may adapt them to work at more scales in the future if need/time permits.

They have been made to work with ESRI Shapefiles from [Geofabrik](http://download.geofabrik.de/) and land polygons from [OpenStreetMapData](http://openstreetmapdata.com/data/land-polygons).

For the sea tint you will need to set your background colour to **R** 184 **G** 217 **B** 247.

I recommend this layer order:
